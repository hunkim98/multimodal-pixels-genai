This is a web service that allows users to generate images with text prompts and pixel image inputs. The usage of pixel image as input to the generation model is optional, and it is up to users to decide whether they would like to input a pixel image input.

The pixel image creation was developed with the help of a opensource pixel art canvas component [Dotting](https://github.com/hunkim98/dotting).
